# Horiseon-accessibility
our first challenge with all the divs




## Users Story
As a coding student I was given a task to pretend I was REAL coder.
At my pretend job, my client is a marketing agency with unreasonable standards like all the marketing agencies that I've worked for IRL.
The following is my User Story and Acceptance Criteria for this project:

#### -Users Story-
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

#### -Acceptance Criteria-

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title


## What I actually did 
* All div elements in HTML where changed to properly reflect their semantic properties.
* CSS code was moved to better reflect the page layout.
* CSS code was condensed to avoid redundancy.
* Link was added to "search engine optimization" in header so it brings you to the SEO article.
* alt tags added to all images in HTML.
* I changed the title to the marketing company name.
